Structure of a Binary Tree
    ->Node: Each element in a binary tree is called a node.
    ->Root: The topmost node of the tree is called the root.
    ->Children: Nodes below the current node are called its children.
    ->Parent: A node that has children is called the parent of its children.
    ->Leaf Node: A node that has no children is called a leaf.
    ->Subtree: Any node in the binary tree, along with its descendants, forms a subtree.
