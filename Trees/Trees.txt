Binary Tree:-

->A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children,
 referred to as the left child and the right child.

Structure of a Binary Tree
    ->Node: Each element in a binary tree is called a node.
    ->Root: The topmost node of the tree is called the root.
    ->Children: Nodes below the current node are called its children.
    ->Parent: A node that has children is called the parent of its children.
    ->Leaf Node: A node that has no children is called a leaf.
    ->Subtree: Any node in the binary tree, along with its descendants, forms a subtree.

Binary Search Tree:-
->A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that has a specific order or property,
 which makes searching for elements efficient. In a BST, for any given node:

        *The left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
        *The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
