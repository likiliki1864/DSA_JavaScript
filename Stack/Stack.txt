Stack:-
*Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element
 added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 

-> Features of a Stack:
*LIFO Principle: The last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. This is analogous to a stack of plates
 where you can only remove the top plate.

->Basic Operations:

    Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
    Pop: Removing the element from the top of the stack and returning it.
    Peek: Returning the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
    isEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.
    Size: Returning the number of elements in the stack.
